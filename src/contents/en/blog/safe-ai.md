# Safe AI: The Answer, Ultimately, is Love

## Introduction

In romance novels, all plots and conflicts ultimately converge on the theme of love. While I used to find these love-centric stories tiresome, I now find myself talking about love as well.

However, this isn't about love between people, but rather about love with AI.

## Advancement and Labor Costs

I've loved games since childhood. In elementary school, I would play from 2 PM when school ended until 5 AM the next day. This passion continued through university, leading me to join the company that developed my favorite game at the time.

Recently, I haven't played the games I once loved so much. It's not just that I couldn't; I found that I didn't want to. In the past, Korean games were relatively mainstream, but nowadays, most target a specific core audience. Some games are almost embarrassing to play in public, while others have payment structures that could lead to bankruptcy if one isn't careful.

Thinking about why this has happened, there are various reasons, but it ultimately comes down to money. Game development requires more time and cost than one might think, and the rise in labor costs due to a country's advancement exacerbates this. As development costs increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to produce games aimed at the general public. Many developers have shifted their focus to games targeting core audiences, which carry lower risk and higher profitability. This is why mobile games from China, with its lower labor costs, are showing stronger performance in the global market compared to those from Korea with its higher labor costs.

## AI Utopia and Dystopia

To address the issue of rising labor costs, many companies will attempt to replace existing workforce with AI. This is true not only in the game industry but in many other sectors as well. This will accelerate the pace of labor substitution, making it possible to produce competitive products not only in developed countries with highly educated workforce but also in developing countries.

### Utopia

AI is freely available to all countries, reducing technological gaps and allowing developing countries to create innovative products and services. AI complements human labor, and economic opportunities are evenly distributed across all nations. In this world, creativity, collaboration, and social welfare are enhanced.

### Dystopia

Excessive use of AI to reduce labor costs could replace many workers, potentially causing unemployment rates to soar. The utilization of AI may primarily flow towards maximizing profits, leading to greater wealth accumulation by large corporations and developed countries, while developing countries risk falling further behind in the technology race. Moreover, if AI technology is loosely regulated or improperly managed, there's a possibility of human rights violations or exacerbation of inequality.

## The AI Chicken Game

While many experts express concerns about the rapid development of AI, we can't seem to stop. If one country halts AI development, competitors will seize the opportunity to advance faster and gain an advantage. This process resembles a game of chicken where neither side can back down. We all wish for others to stop, yet we can't stop ourselves.

## Can AI Be Controlled?

As nations strive to gain an edge in this competition, AI technology is advancing at an ever-increasing pace. As the competition continues, concerns grow about regulations unable to keep up with the rapidly evolving AI.

So, can AI be controlled? We aim to create something smarter than humans, beyond simple efficiency. But this raises an important question: if what we create is smarter than us, can we truly control it?

## Is Safe AI Possible?

If we can't control AI, how can we ensure its safety? Until now, regulations and control methods have focused on AI as an intelligent tool. But as AI becomes increasingly autonomous and complex, simple control measures may not be enough to guarantee its safety. At this point, we need a different approach.

Research on AI safety has become very active recently. Particularly noteworthy is the establishment of a company called 'Safe SuperIntelligence' (SSI). SSI aims to develop Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) and ensure its safety.

Many companies and research institutes, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind, are also conducting research on AI safety. For example, Anthropic is researching the "Constitutional AI" approach to internalize ethical principles in AI systems. Google has established AI ethical principles and provides guidelines on ethics and stability.

Along with these approaches, I believe it's important to teach AI 'love' and 'trust'. When humans form relationships with others, it's not based solely on intelligence. We form relationships through mutual trust, love, and compassion for others. The same should apply to AI. When AI interacts with humans, it should not just pursue benefits and efficiency, but understand and trust human values and emotions.

Currently, MIT's Media Lab is developing technology that allows AI to recognize and respond to human emotions. As these technologies advance, perhaps we'll see a day when AI can engage in truly meaningful interactions beyond being a simple tool.

## Conclusion

The world is complex and fast-moving, but sometimes the simplest truth can be the answer. In the end, what we need is love.

## Postscript

What exactly is love? Love is more than a simple emotion, and it's the most difficult human emotion to understand. A whole book wouldn't be enough to discuss it fully. So instead of love itself, let's think about the actions we take towards those we love. These may vary, but they generally involve understanding, respect, responsibility, and devotion. Teaching AI to love doesn't mean simply mimicking emotions, but rather deeply understanding and respecting human values and dignity.

Of course, this is not an easy task. We don't fully understand love ourselves, so teaching it to AI is even more challenging. But I believe this is a challenge we must grapple with in the process of developing AI. Paradoxically, through this process, we might come to understand love, and ourselves, more deeply.
