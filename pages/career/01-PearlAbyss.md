## Summary

+ July 2021 ~ December 2022
+ GamePlatform Team `(Full time)`
+ Developed custom internal tools to enhance operational efficiency and streamline testing processes
+ Implemented a monitoring and alerting system to quickly detect and share errors during the software build and deployment process, collaborating with QA and developers to improve work processes and productivity
+ Maintained Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, focusing on resolving underlying issues to prevent recurrence of problems instead of merely responding to them
+ Standardized the build system by:
  + Consolidating version control tools from Perforce, SVN, and GitLab to GitLab
  + Unifying build scripts from shell, Python, and Groovy to Groovy
  + Centralizing build tools to Jenkins
+ Constructed a monitoring and alerting system to collect critical error occurrence information from the engine `(using C++, ELK, and Slack)`

## Details

+ Custom Internal Tools Development
  + Developed and maintained various custom internal tools to enhance operational efficiency and streamline testing processes
  + Utilized Python, TypeScript, and Jenkins to create user-friendly interfaces and automate repetitive tasks
  + Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and ensure tools met the needs of users
  + Continuously improved tools based on user feedback and changing project requirements
+ Monitoring and Alerting System Implementation
  + Designed and implemented a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system to quickly detect and share errors during the software build and deployment process
  + Utilized ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Slack to collect, analyze, and visualize log data
  + Collaborated with QA and development teams to establish effective alert thresholds and notification channels
  + Conducted training sessions to help team members understand and utilize the monitoring and alerting system effectively
  + Continuously refined the system based on user feedback and identified areas for improvement
+ Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance
  + Maintained and optimized Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth and efficient software builds and deployments
  + Investigated and resolved pipeline failures, focusing on identifying and addressing the root causes of issues
  + Implemented proactive measures to prevent the recurrence of common problems, such as adding additional validation steps and improving error handling
  + Collaborated with QA teams to incorporate best practices and standardize pipeline configurations across projects
+ Build System Standardization
  + Led an initiative to standardize the build system across the organization, improving consistency and reducing maintenance overhead
  + Consolidated version control tools from Perforce, SVN, and GitLab to GitLab, simplifying source code management and collaboration
  + Unified build scripts from shell, Python, and Groovy to Groovy, creating a more maintainable and scalable build process
  + Centralized build tools to Jenkins, providing a single platform for managing and executing builds across projects
  + Developed and maintained shared libraries and plugins to encapsulate common build functionality and promote code reuse
+ Engine Monitoring and Alerting System
  + Constructed a monitoring and alerting system to collect critical error occurrence information from the game engine
  + Utilized C++ to instrument the engine codebase and capture relevant error data
  + Leveraged ELK stack to store, process, and analyze the collected error data
  + Integrated Slack to provide real-time notifications and alerts to the relevant teams
  + Collaborated with engine developers to define error categories, severity levels, and notification rules
  + Continuously monitored the system's effectiveness and made improvements based on insights gained from the collected data
