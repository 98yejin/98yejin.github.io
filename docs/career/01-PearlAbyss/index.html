<h2>Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>Custom Internal Tools Development
<ul>
<li>Developed and maintained various custom internal tools to enhance operational efficiency and streamline testing processes</li>
<li>Utilized Python, TypeScript, and Jenkins to create user-friendly interfaces and automate repetitive tasks</li>
<li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and ensure tools met the needs of users</li>
<li>Continuously improved tools based on user feedback and changing project requirements</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monitoring and Alerting System Implementation
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system to quickly detect and share errors during the software build and deployment process</li>
<li>Utilized ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Slack to collect, analyze, and visualize log data</li>
<li>Collaborated with QA and development teams to establish effective alert thresholds and notification channels</li>
<li>Conducted training sessions to help team members understand and utilize the monitoring and alerting system effectively</li>
<li>Continuously refined the system based on user feedback and identified areas for improvement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance
<ul>
<li>Maintained and optimized Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth and efficient software builds and deployments</li>
<li>Investigated and resolved pipeline failures, focusing on identifying and addressing the root causes of issues</li>
<li>Implemented proactive measures to prevent the recurrence of common problems, such as adding additional validation steps and improving error handling</li>
<li>Collaborated with QA teams to incorporate best practices and standardize pipeline configurations across projects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build System Standardization
<ul>
<li>Led an initiative to standardize the build system across the organization, improving consistency and reducing maintenance overhead</li>
<li>Consolidated version control tools from Perforce, SVN, and GitLab to GitLab, simplifying source code management and collaboration</li>
<li>Unified build scripts from shell, Python, and Groovy to Groovy, creating a more maintainable and scalable build process</li>
<li>Centralized build tools to Jenkins, providing a single platform for managing and executing builds across projects</li>
<li>Developed and maintained shared libraries and plugins to encapsulate common build functionality and promote code reuse</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Engine Monitoring and Alerting System
<ul>
<li>Constructed a monitoring and alerting system to collect critical error occurrence information from the game engine</li>
<li>Utilized C++ to instrument the engine codebase and capture relevant error data</li>
<li>Leveraged ELK stack to store, process, and analyze the collected error data</li>
<li>Integrated Slack to provide real-time notifications and alerts to the relevant teams</li>
<li>Collaborated with engine developers to define error categories, severity levels, and notification rules</li>
<li>Continuously monitored the system's effectiveness and made improvements based on insights gained from the collected data</li>
</ul></li>
